                                    Registration at <b>http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/LoginCamp.asp</b> We've secured our Silicon Valley Code Camp Date (October 6th and 7th, 2012) at Foothill College again and the web site is up and ready for sessions to be submitted.  As a past code camp speaker, I'm sending you this email to ask you to put up sessions you plan on giving.  Several people have voiced the concern that they are not sure what their schedule is on October and I totally understand that.  I still would like you to put up sessions that you can do, and if you have to cancel, I understand.<br />
                                    <br />

                                    Also, as soon as we get enough sessions up, I plan to start rallying in earnest for sponsors.  If you have any potential sponsors, please let me know and I can forward you or them our sponsor documents, or just let me know who and I'll follow up.<br />
                                    <br />

                                    We are looking forward to another awesome year!  This is year 7 in counting.  Thanks for all your support over these past years.  You, the speakers are hugely responsible for the success of this event and you are all very much appreciated for volunteering your time.<br />
                                    <br />
