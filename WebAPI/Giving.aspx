        <h2>Join Silicon Valley Code Camp In Investing In Our Future!</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
        <p>
            For going on 8 years, Foothill college has partnered with Silicon Valley Code Camp to put on arguably the best
        free open technical learning event in the world.  We've done it with hundreds of volunteer speakers, hundreds of
        enthusiastic volunteers, and many generous industry sponsors who see our value.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            It's time to give back!  For the past couple years, we have already been giving significant monitary donations to Foothill College based on
            our success.  Let's together, take this to the next level by enjoining our sponsors to participate in giving a possible future to the Tens of Thousands
            of students who pass through the same campus we enjoy Silicon Valley Code Camp at
        </p>
