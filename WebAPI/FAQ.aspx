        <h3>What is Code Camp?&nbsp; </h3>
        <p>Code Camp is a new type of community event where developers learn from fellow developers. All are welcome to attend and speak.</p>
        <p>
            This Code Camp consists of these points: (1) by and for the developer community; (2) always free; (3) 
community developed material; (4) never occur during working hours.
        </p>

        <h3>Where is Code Camp?</h3>
        <p>
            Silicon Valley Code Camp has been always held at Foothill College in Los Altos 
    California.&nbsp; For more details click
    <a href="http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/Location.aspx">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>



        <h3>What can I expect at the Silicon Valley Code Camp?</h3>
        <p>
            Two full days of talking about code with fellow developers. Sessions will 
range from informal “chalk talks” to presentations. There will be a mix of 
presenters, some experienced folks, for some it may be their first opportunity 
to speak in public. And we are expecting to see people from throughout the 
Northern California region and beyond.
        </p>
        <p>Watch this site for more details and schedule as we firm things up.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Is this a Microsoft (or open source, Java, etc) event?</h3>
        <p>
            The answer is no (or all of the above depending on your perspective). This is 
a
    Silicon Valley developer community event and not any other 
company's. Everyone is welcome to present so long as it fits the Code Camp 
guidelines (must be about code somehow, and isn't a direct blatant advertisement for a product 
or service).
        </p>

        <p>
            Don't think about Code Camp in terms of what technological faction it caters 
to... it's not like other events. Think about it as an event where developers 
convene and share their knowledge and experience. Everyone is welcome and 
encouraged to participate!
        </p>

        <h3>How do I speak at the Silicon Valley Code Camp?</h3>
        <p>
            After you have registered, go to the 
    <asp:HyperLink ID="HyperLinkSessions" NavigateUrl="~/Sessions.aspx" runat="server">Sessions</asp:HyperLink>
            page and click on the right side where it says <u>Submit a Session</u>.  Enter your proposed
     description and title.  Make sure to assign it some categories, and you will be notified if
     the topic has been accepted by our speakers panel.  We try to have as much diversity as we can.
        </p>

        <h3>How long are the sessions?</h3>
        <p>
            Sessions are 75 minutes long. The general rule of thumb for a presentation is 
to have 60 minutes for presentation and 15 minutes for questions. This is just a 
guideline, though; if you need the whole time for your demo, it's your session. 
Likewise, if you'd like to have an open discussion for the entire time, that's 
okay too.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have tried having a slot with shorter-length sessions, 
but haven't had success. Keep in mind as you estimate the 
length of your presentation that things will run longer with the give &amp; take 
(mostly take :) of an audience in the room. An hour goes by very quickly when 
people are asking questions!
        </p>

        <h3>I have my own group, Can I host my group at Code Camp?</h3>
        <p>
            Actually, no you can't.  We'd be happy to have you register at code camp and come and participate in the activities here, but
we are not trying to be a hosting event for other events.  If you want suggestions on how to create your meetings, find venues, organize
sponsors, provide free food, build a web site, etc., we love to talk about that.  Come on out and talk to us but we really don't want to be the hoster of 
other events.
